## Changes Made

### 1. Building & Room Selection Interface

**Before:** Users had to manually type room numbers into text fields.

**After:** Users now select buildings from dropdowns, which dynamically populate room dropdowns with available rooms for that building.

#### HTML Changes (public/index.html:106-173)
- Replaced 7 text inputs with 7 pairs of building/room dropdowns
- Each day now has:
  - Building selection dropdown
  - Room selection dropdown (filtered by selected building)
- Added CSS classes: `schedule-grid`, `schedule-day`, `day-label`, `building-select`, `room-select`

### 2. Improved CSS Styling (public/css/styles.css:478-547)

**Schedule Grid:**
```css
.schedule-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(140px, 1fr));
  gap: 16px;
}
```

**Schedule Day Cards:**
- Each day is displayed in a card with:
  - Light gray background (#f8f9fa)
  - Border and rounded corners
  - Proper spacing between dropdowns
  - Blue color-coded labels

**Form Width:**
- Form automatically expands to 90% width (max 1100px) when schedule is present
- Ensures all 7 days fit comfortably on screen

**Table Display:**
- Schedule cells are center-aligned
- Room numbers displayed in blue (#0066cc)
- Empty cells show "-" in gray

### 3. JavaScript Enhancements (public/js/modules/people.module.js)

#### New Functions:

**`populateScheduleBuildingDropdowns()`** (line 67)
- Populates all 7 building dropdowns with available buildings
- Attaches change event listeners to trigger room filtering

**`populateRoomsForDay(day, buildingId)`** (line 90)
- Dynamically filters and populates room dropdown based on selected building
- Displays room number with floor information: "101 (Floor 1)"

**`getScheduleFromForm()`** (line 111)
- Extracts selected room IDs from all 7 room dropdowns
- Returns array of room IDs (not room numbers)

**`setScheduleToForm(schedule)`** (line 127)
- Loads existing schedule into form
- Automatically selects correct building for each day
- Populates and selects correct room for each day

#### Updated Functions:

**`addPersonInput()`** (line 152)
- Calls `populateScheduleBuildingDropdowns()` before showing form

**`editPerson()`** (line 170)
- Calls `populateScheduleBuildingDropdowns()` before loading schedule
- Properly reconstructs building/room selections from stored room IDs

**`addPersonDom()`** (line 218)
- Converts stored room IDs to room numbers for display
- Shows room number instead of room ID in table cells

### 4. Data Model

**Storage:** Room IDs are stored as JSON arrays in the database
```javascript
// Example schedule stored in database:
schedule: '["1", "1", "", "1", "1", "", ""]'
// Room ID 1 assigned to days 1, 2, 4, 5
// Days 3, 6, 7 are empty (off days)
```

**Display:** Room numbers are shown to users (not IDs)
```
Table: 101 | 101 | - | 101 | 101 | - | -
```

### 5. Improved Date Headers (public/js/start.js:11-34)

- Fixed typo: "Thur" → "Thu"
- Added month names to headers: "Mon Oct 15" instead of "Mon 15"
- Cleaner, more professional date display

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
1. User had to know room numbers
2. User had to manually type room numbers
3. Risk of typos and invalid room numbers
4. No validation or guidance

### After
1. User selects building from dropdown
2. Only valid rooms for that building are shown
3. Rooms display with helpful info (floor number)
4. No risk of invalid room assignments
5. Clear visual organization with cards
6. Professional, modern interface

---

## Technical Benefits

1. **Data Integrity:** Only valid room IDs can be selected
2. **Relational Consistency:** Rooms are always associated with correct buildings
3. **Scalability:** Works with any number of buildings and rooms
4. **Maintainability:** Clear separation of concerns
5. **Performance:** Efficient filtering using roomsCache
6. **Accessibility:** Proper labels and semantic HTML

## Testing

### Verification:
- ✅ All 5 backend tests passing
- ✅ Zero linting errors
- ✅ Database successfully reset with new schema
