# Task Analysis and Implementation Status

This document tracks the completion status of tasks outlined in the README.md file.

## Task Overview

The README lists 4 main tasks:
1. Add some tests (Mocha test suite for backend and frontend)
2. Complete the person table - at minimum the edit function
3. Convert backend to use non-volatile data store (SQLite)
4. Add further elements - Landlords and Buildings (Buildings require Rooms)

---

## Task 1: Add Tests ✅ COMPLETED

### Status: COMPLETED

### What Was Done:
- Mocha test framework installed and configured
- Chai assertion library added
- Test suite configured in package.json with two scripts:
  - `npm test` - Run all tests
  - `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- Backend tests created in `test/backend/people.spec.js`
- Frontend test file created in `test/frontend/dom.spec.js`

### Test Coverage:
**Backend Tests (People API):**
- ✅ `get()` returns an array of people
- ✅ `get()` returns people with required properties (id, name, email, notes)
- ✅ `add()` adds a new person and returns it with an id
- ✅ `add()` updates an existing person when id is provided
- ✅ `add()` generates sequential ids for new people

**Test Results:**
```
5 passing (5ms)
```

### Notes:
- Frontend tests exist but are minimal (imported functions only)
- Additional tests should be added for landlords, buildings, and rooms once implemented
- jsdom is installed for DOM testing capabilities

## Task 2: Complete Person Table - Edit Function ✅ COMPLETED

### Status: COMPLETED

### What Was Done:
The edit functionality for the person table has been fully implemented in `public/js/people.js`:

#### Implementation Details:
1. **Edit Button**: Each person row has an "Edit" button (line 125-128)
2. **Edit Function** (`editperson()` at line 78-105):
   - Retrieves the person data from cache using the row's `data-person-id` attribute
   - Pre-fills the form with existing person data
   - Validates that person data exists before proceeding
   - Shows error alert if data cannot be loaded
3. **Update Function** (`updateperson()` at line 40-42):
   - Sends PUT request with person id to update existing record
   - Backend properly handles update when id is present
4. **Form Handling**:
   - Form is cleared before editing
   - All fields are populated with current values
   - On submit, calls `updateperson()` with the person's id
   - After update, refreshes the table to show changes

#### Key Features:
- Uses `peopleCache` to efficiently retrieve person data without additional API calls
- Proper error handling with user-friendly alerts
- Follows the same pattern as add functionality for consistency
- Backend `add()` function in `lib/people.js` handles both create (no id) and update (with id) operations

## Task 3: Convert Backend to Non-Volatile Data Store (SQLite) ⚠️ NOT COMPLETED

### Status: NOT COMPLETED

### Current State:
- Data is stored in-memory in JavaScript arrays
- Data is lost when the server restarts
- No database file present in the project

### What Needs to Be Done:
1. Install SQLite package (`better-sqlite3` or `sqlite3`)
2. Create database schema for:
   - People table
   - Landlords table
   - Buildings table
   - Rooms table
3. Implement database initialization script
4. Update backend functions in `lib/` to use database queries instead of array operations
5. Maintain the same API interface (get/add functions) for backward compatibility
6. Add proper error handling for database operations
7. Consider migrations for schema changes

### Recommendation:
Use `better-sqlite3` as it's synchronous and easier to work with for this use case.

## Task 4: Add Further Elements - Landlords, Buildings, and Rooms ⚠️ PARTIALLY COMPLETED

### Status: PARTIALLY COMPLETED (Frontend Only)

### Landlords - Frontend ✅ COMPLETED
**File**: `public/js/landlords.js`

#### Implemented:
- ✅ Full CRUD frontend functionality
- ✅ Fetch landlords from API (`fetchlandlords()`)
- ✅ Add new landlord (`addlandlord()`)
- ✅ Edit existing landlord (`editlandlord()`)
- ✅ Update landlord (`updatelandlord()`)
- ✅ Render landlords in table (`addlandlorddom()`)
- ✅ Form handling with validation
- ✅ Cache system for efficient data access
- ✅ Edit button with pre-filled form data

#### Fields:
- Name (required)
- Email
- Phone
- Notes

### Buildings - Frontend ✅ COMPLETED
**File**: `public/js/buildings.js`

#### Implemented:
- ✅ Full CRUD frontend functionality
- ✅ Fetch buildings from API (`fetchbuildings()`)
- ✅ Add new building (`addbuilding()`)
- ✅ Edit existing building (`editbuilding()`)
- ✅ Update building (`updatebuilding()`)
- ✅ Render buildings in table (`addbuildingdom()`)
- ✅ Landlord dropdown population (`populateLandlordDropdown()`)
- ✅ Relationship with landlords (foreign key: `landlord_id`)
- ✅ "Rooms" button for navigating to building's rooms
- ✅ Cache system for efficient data access

#### Fields:
- Name (required)
- Address
- Landlord (dropdown, relationship to landlords table)
- Notes

### Rooms - ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

#### What Needs to Be Done:
1. Create `public/js/rooms.js` frontend module
2. Implement CRUD operations for rooms
3. Add relationship to buildings (foreign key: `building_id`)
4. Implement filtering to show rooms by building
5. Handle the hash navigation from buildings view (`#rooms?building=${building.id}`)

#### Suggested Fields:
- Room Number (required)
- Building (dropdown, relationship to buildings table)
- Floor
- Capacity
- Notes

### Backend - ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

#### Missing Backend Files:
- `lib/landlords.js` - Backend logic for landlords
- `lib/buildings.js` - Backend logic for buildings
- `lib/rooms.js` - Backend logic for rooms

#### What Needs to Be Done:
1. Create backend modules following the pattern in `lib/people.js`:
   - Export `get()` function to fetch all records
   - Export `add()` function to handle both create and update
   - Maintain in-memory arrays (for now) or implement with SQLite
2. Update `lib/api.js` to register new routes:
   - `/api/landlords` - GET and PUT methods
   - `/api/buildings` - GET and PUT methods
   - `/api/rooms` - GET and PUT methods
3. Implement relationships:
   - Buildings should include landlord name when fetching
   - Rooms should include building name when fetching
4. Add proper error handling

#### Missing Import in Frontend:
- `public/js/start.js` does NOT import `landlords.js` or `buildings.js`
- This means the landlords and buildings functionality will not load on page load
- Need to add imports:
  ```javascript
  import "./landlords.js"
  import "./buildings.js"
  ```

## Summary

### Completed Tasks:
1. ✅ **Tests**: Mocha test suite fully set up with 5 passing tests for people backend
2. ✅ **Person Edit Function**: Fully implemented with proper error handling
3. ✅ **Landlords Frontend**: Complete CRUD implementation
4. ✅ **Buildings Frontend**: Complete CRUD implementation with landlord relationship

### Incomplete Tasks:
1. ❌ **SQLite Database**: Not implemented - data is still in-memory
2. ❌ **Backend for Landlords**: No API handlers or data layer
3. ❌ **Backend for Buildings**: No API handlers or data layer
4. ❌ **Rooms**: Not implemented at all (frontend or backend)
5. ❌ **Module Imports**: Landlords and buildings not imported in start.js
6. ❌ **Additional Tests**: No tests for landlords, buildings, or rooms

### Code Quality:
- ✅ **Linting**: All code passes ESLint checks (no errors)
- ✅ **Style Compliance**: Code follows project style guide (Yoda conditions, no semicolons, 2-space indent)
- ✅ **Git Etiquette**: Clean commit history with descriptive messages

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **High Priority**: Import landlords and buildings modules in `start.js`
2. **High Priority**: Create backend API handlers and data layers for landlords and buildings
3. **High Priority**: Implement rooms functionality (backend and frontend)
4. **Medium Priority**: Implement SQLite database for data persistence
5. **Medium Priority**: Add tests for landlords, buildings, and rooms
6. **Low Priority**: Add delete functionality for all entities
7. **Low Priority**: UI improvements and enhancements

## Code Organization Notes

### Frontend Architecture:
- Modular ES6 structure
- Each entity has its own module (people.js, landlords.js, buildings.js)
- Shared utilities in form.js, dom.js, and api.js
- Consistent patterns across all modules

### Backend Architecture:
- Simple routing in lib/api.js with route-to-handler mapping
- Each entity has its own data module (currently only people.js exists)
- RESTful API design (GET for fetch, PUT for create/update)

### Data Flow:
1. User interaction → Frontend module
2. Frontend module → api.js wrapper
3. api.js → HTTP request to backend
4. Backend api.js → Route handler in entity module
5. Entity module → Data operation
6. Response → Frontend → DOM update
